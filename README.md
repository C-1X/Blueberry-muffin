Method
Preheat the oven to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C. Line a muffin tin with 12 cases.
Put the streusel topping ingredients in a small bowl and rub together using the tips of your fingers to a crumbly mix; set aside.
Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder and cinnamon in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the butter, maple syrup, vanilla, yogurt and eggs until just combined. Pour into the flour mixture and mix until just combined. Gently fold in 125g blueberries.
Divide the batter between the cases. Dot with the reserved blueberries and sprinkle over the streusel mix. Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of a muffin comes out clean. They will keep for up to 4 days in an airtight container.
